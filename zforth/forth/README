In this directory you can find various snippets, examples and tests of zForth
code.


core.zf           This file defines basic forth words and control structures.
                  You will probably need this if you want to do anything useful,
                  and all other examples and snippets depend on this.

mandel.zf         Demo ASCII mandelbrot, requires a floating point type for zf_cell

memaccess.zf      Words for accessing memory with various types.
